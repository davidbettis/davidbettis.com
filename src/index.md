# Projects

## Open Recipe

Love cooking? Tired of ad-cluttered recipe sites and apps? Frustruated with apps that lock you into their ecosystem?  Open Recipe helps you collect, organize, and search your recipes on your own terms. Store your library in your personal cloud and persist them with RecipeMD, an open, human-readable format you actually own.

## Shapes

A [fun abstract-art thing](/shapes/) written in Rust, using WebAssembly. Inspired by an [After Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_%28software%29) screensaver from the early 90s. Source available on [Github](https://github.com/davidbettis/shapes).
