# Projects

## Open Cookbook

[Open Cookbook](open-cookbook/) is an app that allows you to collect, organize, and search recipes on your own terms. It empowers you to store your recipe library on your device or own personal cloud in RecipeMD, an open human-readable recipe format. *Coming early 2026*

## Shapes

A [fun abstract-art thing](shapes/) written in Rust, using WebAssembly. Inspired by an [After Dark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Dark_%28software%29) screensaver from the early 90s. Source available on [Github](https://github.com/davidbettis/shapes).
