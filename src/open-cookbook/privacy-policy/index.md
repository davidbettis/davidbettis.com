# Privacy Policy for Open Cookbook

Last updated: 2026-02-02

## No Data Collection by Us

Open Cookbook does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data with us, the app developers. We respect your privacy and have designed our app to operate entirely on your device.

What This Means:

* No analytics or tracking
* No advertising networks
* No crash reporting that sends data to us
* No user accounts or authentication
* No data stored on external servers controlled by us
* All processing happens locally on your device

## Your Recipe Data

Open Cookbook allows you to create and store recipes within the app. This recipe data is yours and stays with you. We, the developers and maintainers of Open Cookbook, have no access to it.

You can choose where your recipe data is stored:

* **On your device:** Your recipes are stored locally and remain entirely on your device.
* **On iCloud Drive:** If you choose to store your recipes on iCloud Drive, your recipes are stored in your personal Apple account for backup and syncing across your devices. This data is subject to Apple's privacy policy, and we have no access to it.

## Images in Recipes

You may choose to include images in your recipes by providing URLs to external image sources. When the app renders these images, it retrieves them directly from those external servers. Those servers may see standard web request information (such as your IP address), but this is not collected or controlled by us.

## Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any data from users, our app is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our data practices, we will update this privacy policy and notify users through an app update.
