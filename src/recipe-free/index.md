# Recipe Free

## Summary

Recipe Free is an app that lets you organize, search, and view your recipe library on your own terms without being locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Recipes are stored on your personal device or your iCloud drive. Recipes are formatted in [RecipeMD](https://recipemd.org/), an open format based on markdown. Build a recipe library you can pass down to your kids.
