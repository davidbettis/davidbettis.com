# Privacy Policy for Recipe Free

Last updated: 2026-01-15

## No Data Collection

Recipe Free does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or usage data. We respect your privacy and have designed our app to operate entirely on your device.

What This Means:
* No analytics or tracking
* No advertising networks
* No crash reporting that sends data to us
* No user accounts or authentication
* No data stored on external servers
* All processing happens locally on your device

## Third-Party Services

Our app does not integrate with any third-party services that collect data. When the app loads images from external URLs, those servers may see standard web request information (such as IP addresses), but this is not collected or controlled by us.

## Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any data, our app is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change our data practices, we will update this privacy policy and notify users through an app update.
